			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Who We Are</h2>
			<p>The Data Controller responsible for your personal information is:</p>
			<p>ROVR LABS INC. (DBA Flirtual)<br />6d - 7398 Yonge St, #776<br />Thornhill, ON, Canada, L4J 8J2</p>

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Data We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Profile Data:</strong> To facilitate connecting you with other users, we display the profile information
				you provide us (such as your display name, profile pictures, bio, and age) to them, and factor some of this
				information into our matchmaking algorithm. You may voluntarily provide sensitive information (such as your
				sexuality and location) to be displayed on your profile. You can control the visibility of some profile data in
				the Privacy Settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Account Data:</strong> When you sign up, you provide us with account details (such as your email
				address) to create your account and authenticate you. We use your email to send you transactional notifications
				and, with your permission, marketing communications.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Message Data:</strong> We process the messages you send in order to facilitate communications with other
				users.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Purchase Data:</strong> If you make a purchase, we collect your transaction details (such as
				subscription type and billing history) to fulfill your order and comply with accounting requirements. We do not
				store your full payment card details directly; they are processed securely by our payment partners.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Connected Platform Data:</strong> If you connect an external account, we collect information from it
				(such as your Discord ID or VRChat username). We use this data to enable social sign-in, share your connected
				profile with matches to facilitate communications, display connected content on your profile, or support other
				integrations.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Verification Data:</strong> If you choose to verify your identity or age, or where required by law, we
				may process your government-issued ID and/or biometric data (such as photo, video, and face geometry) to confirm
				your identity.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect data about how you use our service (such as when you access it, how you
				navigate and interact with it). We use this data to provide and improve the service.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Technical Data:</strong> We collect data from your device (such as IP address, device/browser
				identifiers, error/crash data, hardware and software information). We use this data to secure your account,
				customize your experience, and improve our service.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, we may use the above data to ensure the safety and security of our platform, prevent fraud,
				provide customer support, and comply with legal requirements. We may use aggregate or anonymized data to promote
				our service.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
			<p>We process your data under the following legal bases:</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> To provide our service (such as matchmaking, messaging, and facilitating
				social interactions).
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> To ensure the safety and security of our platform, prevent fraud, and
				analyze usage to improve our service.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> To comply with valid legal requests and reporting requirements.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Consent:</strong> For sensitive personal information you voluntarily provide (such as sexual
				orientation, precise geolocation, and biometric data) and for marketing communications. You may withdraw this
				consent at any time in the Settings.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Automated Profiling</h2>
			<p>
				We use an automated matchmaking algorithm to suggest compatible users to you, and to suggest your profile to
				other users. Our algorithm considers factors including matching profile data (such as interest tags, personality
				similarity, and geographic proximity), recent activity, and whether a user has already expressed interest in
				your profile. These factors are prioritized according to a combination of our preset values and, in some cases,
				user-defined weights. Results are filtered based on your preferences and theirs (such as gender, age, and other
				filters you choose). We do not use profiling to make decisions that produce legal or similarly significant
				effects on you.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How We Share Data</h2>
			<p>
				We use trusted third parties to help us provide our services. We share data with them only to the extent
				necessary for them to perform their specific function. We review third parties we engage with to ensure they
				have adequate data protection and information security measures in place. We take measures to protect and
				anonymize data shared with third parties, as appropriate given the nature of the services provided. We do not
				sell your data.
			</p>

				<strong>In-App Functionality Services:</strong> To facilitate key features such as messaging and image hosting.
			</p>

				facilitate other integrations.

				service.

				and Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers to other providers or jurisdictions. Canada is recognized by the
				European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection.

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How Long We Retain Your Data</h2>
			<p>
				We retain transaction records, customer support records, and supporting data for 7 years to comply with
				accounting requirements.

			<p>
				If you verify your identity or age, your ID and biometric data is deleted immediately after the verification is
				complete.
			</p>
			<p>
				If your account is suspended for violating our terms, we retain limited data necessary to prevent you from
				opening a new account (such as your email, usernames, IP address, and device/browser identifiers) and moderation
				records (such as reports, flagged data, and enforcement actions) for as long as necessary to ensure the safety
				of our platform.
			</p>
			<p>
				Otherwise, we retain your data until your account is deleted. If your account remains inactive for two years, we
				will automatically delete it. If your account is suspended for violating our terms, we will automatically delete
				it (except the limited safety data described above) after 30 days.
			</p>
			<p>
				When your account is deleted or you remove specific data from your profile, it is immediately deleted from our
				production systems. It may persist in disaster recovery snapshots for up to 7 days before being permanently
				erased.
