				Your username, your display name, your profile pictures, your bio, your age, your gender, your matchmaking
				preferences, your personal interest tags, your selected VR apps/games, and whether or not you are new to VR will
				be visible to other users. Your additional profile information (including your sexuality, NSFW tags, country,
				linked accounts, etc.) will be visible or hidden to other users depending on your privacy settings, which you
				can modify at any time. Your personality traits (which we identify based on your answers to our personality
				questionnaire) will be visible or hidden to other users depending on your privacy settings, but your specific
				questionnaire answers will not be visible.
			</p>

			<p>
				We use first-party, on-premises data analytics. We may share anonymized statistics about Flirtual (for example,
				the number of users that use a particular Social VR app or game). You can opt out of these statistics in your
				privacy settings.
			</p>

			<p>
				Your messages and message history with other users are hosted by and shared with TalkJS, but will not be shared
				with other third-parties.
			</p>

			<p>
				Your account email will not be shown to other users. Your account email may be accessed by third parties in
				order to deliver transactional, marketing, and support messages according to your preferences. You may opt out
				of message email notifications, which will remove your email address from TalkJS' records.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you suspect your account has been compromised, please change your password immediately and report the issue
				with the word 'URGENT' in the subject line. In the message, include your username, the last time you accessed
				the site, and any details that led you to suspect a break-in.
			</p>

			<p>Your password is stored hashed and salted.</p>

			<p>
				We use certain trusted third parties that provide services to Flirtual. We may share user personal data with
				these third parties, but only for the purpose of providing their services. For more information and examples,
				see below.
			</p>

				operating our platform (for example, Fly.io and Vercel).

				<strong>In-App Functionality Services:</strong> to facilitate key features such as messaging and optimized image
				hosting within our app (for example, TalkJS).
			</p>

			<p><strong>Billing Services:</strong> to manage payments and subscriptions (for example, Stripe).</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Social Media Services:</strong> to allow users to connect their accounts with our platform and
				facilitate social interactions (for example, Discord).
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Security and Performance Services:</strong> to safeguard our platform, protect our users, and enhance

			<p>
				We review third parties we engage with to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security
				measures in place. We take measures to protect and anonymize data shared with third parties, as appropriate
				given the nature of the services provided. We only provide trusted third parties with the personal data
				necessary for the service they are providing.
