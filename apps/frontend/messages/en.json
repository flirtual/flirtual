Kyle has been obsessed with VR since the early days of Oculus, but it really changed his life when he joined VRChat and met some of his closest friends (including his wife!) there. Right before COVID hit, Kyle brought his childhood best friend Tony along for the journey, and VR also changed his life. We set out to help others meet awesome people around the world too, starting with VRLFP (Virtual Reality Looking For Partner).</p><p>Immersive presence in VR helps you form deep connections with people anywhere in the world. By bridging geographic distance and putting personality first, our mission is to find the very best people for you, wherever they are. And to make dating safer and more magical!</p><p>In 2022, VRLFP became Flirtual. Rebuilt from the ground up, we've enhanced matchmaking, added personality & interest tags, and launched improved apps. Whether you're looking for a serious relationship that transitions into real life, something more casual in VR, or just new homies, we're ready to help find your perfect match.</p><group><logo/><p>❤ kfarwell, Tony & The Flirtual Team</p><discord>Join our Discord</discord></group><p><italic>P.S. We've come a long way from VRLFP's humble beginnings, but we're still a small team rooted in the VR community. <br/><br/>We appreciate your patience as we work hard to make Flirtual as awesome as it can be. Please let us know if you <contact>find any bugs</contact> or <ideas>have any suggestions</ideas>!</italic></p></section><section><h1>The team</h1><team-list/></section><section><h1>Timeline</h1><timeline/></section>",

We don't have many flashy new features to share, but we've been hard at work behind the scenes on performance, stability, matchmaking & safety. You should find things load much faster, encounter a lot less bugs/errors, and see more relevant profiles. Had trouble the last time you used Flirtual? Give it another try and <contact>let us know</contact> if you're still having any issues!</p><p>We do have a couple small new features:</p><ul><li>📍 When you expand someone's profile picture that was taken in VRChat, you'll now see a link in the corner to visit the world it was taken in.<ul><li>This will appear for pictures taken recently with metadata enabled in the VRChat camera options or in VRCX. Don't worry, we still remove all other image metadata for your privacy!</li></ul></li><li>🔗 When you add your VRChat username to your profile, we'll look it up and link it directly instead of taking you to the search page.</li><li>🔎 You can now adjust Flirtual's font size in the <appearance>Appearance Settings</appearance>.</li><li>🔒 For your account's security, we'll now email you a verification code when you log in from a new location.</li><li>🔑 Passkeys are now supported on iOS. Add one in the <password>Password & Passkeys Settings</password> to log in more conveniently & securely.</li></ul><h2>What's coming in 2026</h2><ul><li>Translations. Finally!</li><li>Geolocation. You'll be able to optionally share your location to see people near you. Compared to our current country-based matchmaking, this will help folks in big countries like the US find people within the same/neighboring states, as well as folks in places like Europe find people in neighboring countries.<ul><li>We'll store your location with a random offset, only show approximate distance, and have additional measures to protect your privacy.</li></ul></li><li>Timezones. You'll be able to add your timezone to your profile and see how much later or earlier it is for other people.</li><li>Advanced filters and more matchmaking improvements.</li><li>More account connections/integrations.</li><li>And much more!

(DBA Flirtual)<br/>6d - 7398 Yonge St, #776<br/>Thornhill, ON, Canada, L4J 8J2</p><h1>Data We Collect and How We Use It</h1><p><strong>Profile Data:</strong> To facilitate connecting you with other users, we display the profile information you provide us (such as your display name, profile pictures, bio, and age) to them, and factor some of this information into our matchmaking algorithm. You may voluntarily provide sensitive information (such as your sexuality and location) to be displayed on your profile. You can control the visibility of some profile data in the <settings-privacy>Privacy Settings</settings-privacy>.</p><p><strong>Account Data:</strong> When you sign up, you provide us with account details (such as your email address) to create your account and authenticate you. We use your email to send you transactional notifications and, with your permission, marketing communications.</p><p><strong>Message Data:</strong> We process the messages you send in order to facilitate communications with other users.</p><p><strong>Purchase Data:</strong> If you make a purchase, we collect your transaction details (such as subscription type and billing history) to fulfill your order and comply with accounting requirements. We do not store your full payment card details directly; they are processed securely by our payment partners.</p><p><strong>Connected Platform Data:</strong> If you connect an external account, we collect information from it (such as your Discord ID or VRChat username). We use this data to enable social sign-in, share your connected profile with matches to facilitate communications, display connected content on your profile, or support other integrations.</p><p><strong>Verification Data:</strong> If you choose to verify your identity or age, or where required by law, we may process your government-issued ID and/or biometric data (such as photo, video, and face geometry) to confirm your identity.</p><p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect data about how you use our service (such as when you access it, how you navigate and interact with it). We use this data to provide and improve the service.</p><p><strong>Technical Data:</strong> We collect data from your device (such as IP address, device/browser identifiers, error/crash data, hardware and software information). We use this data to secure your account, customize your experience, and improve our service.</p><p>Additionally, we may use the above data to ensure the safety and security of our platform, prevent fraud, provide customer support, and comply with legal requirements. We may use aggregate or anonymized data to promote our service.</p><h1>Legal Basis for Processing</h1><p>We process your data under the following legal bases:</p><p><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> To provide our service (such as matchmaking, messaging, and facilitating social interactions).</p><p><strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> To ensure the safety and security of our platform, prevent fraud, and analyze usage to improve our service.</p><p><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> To comply with valid legal requests and reporting requirements.</p><p><strong>Consent:</strong> For sensitive personal information you voluntarily provide (such as sexual orientation, precise geolocation, and biometric data) and for marketing communications. You may withdraw this consent at any time in the <settings>Settings</settings>.</p><h1>Automated Profiling</h1><p>We use an automated matchmaking algorithm to suggest compatible users to you, and to suggest your profile to other users. Our algorithm considers factors including matching profile data (such as interest tags, personality similarity, and geographic proximity), recent activity, and whether a user has already expressed interest in your profile. These factors are prioritized according to a combination of our preset values and, in some cases, user-defined weights. Results are filtered based on your preferences and theirs (such as gender, age, and other filters you choose). We do not use profiling to make decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects on you.</p><h1>How We Share Data</h1><p>We use trusted third parties to help us provide our services. We share data with them only to the extent necessary for them to perform their specific function. We review third parties we engage with to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place. We take measures to protect and anonymize data shared with third parties, as appropriate given the nature of the services provided. We do not sell your data.</p><p><strong>Cloud Hosting Services:</strong> To provide reliable infrastructure for managing our platform.</p><p><strong>In-App Functionality Services:</strong> To facilitate key features such as messaging and image hosting.</p><p><strong>Billing Services:</strong> To manage payments and subscriptions.</p><p><strong>Connected Platform Services:</strong> To enable social sign-in, display connected information, and facilitate other integrations.</p><p><strong>Security and Performance Services:</strong> To safeguard our platform and deliver content globally.</p><p><strong>Insight and Improvement Services:</strong> To analyze usage and technical data in order to improve our service.</p><p><strong>Communication Services:</strong> To deliver transactional notifications and marketing communications.</p><p><strong>Moderation Services:</strong> To detect harmful content, and ensure the safety and security of our platform.</p><p><strong>Verification Services:</strong> To securely verify your identity and age.</p><p><strong>IT Services:</strong> To assist in business operations, such as ticketing systems for customer support.</p><p><strong>Legal Authorities and Safety Organizations:</strong> To comply with valid legal requests and reporting requirements.</p><h1>International Data Transfers</h1><p>We are headquartered in Canada. Your data is processed on servers located in the United States, accessed by our global team, and delivered via a global edge network.</p><p>By using Flirtual, you acknowledge that your data may be processed in countries outside your residence (including the US, Canada, and others) to ensure performance and support our business operations.</p><p>For users in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, we rely on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework for transfers to certified US providers; and Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers to other providers or jurisdictions.

If you are unsatisfied with the result of your appeal, you may contact the Attorney General of your state.</p><p>If you have any concerns about how we process your data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the <complaint-ca>Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada</complaint-ca> or, depending on your jurisdiction, your local data protection authority if you believe your data has not been handled in accordance with the GDPR, CCPA, or other local data privacy regulations:</p><p><strong>European Union and European Economic Area:</strong> <complaint-eu>Find your national supervisory authority here</complaint-eu>.</p><p><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> <complaint-uk>Information Commissioner's Office</complaint-uk>.</p><p><strong>California:</strong> <complaint-us-ca>Attorney General's Office</complaint-us-ca>.</p><p><strong>Other jurisdictions:</strong> Depending on your location, other data protection laws may grant you similar or additional rights.
